## JSON Templates

Each of the files in folder need to be placed in proper locations with new information dependant on your development environment in them. See the root [read me](https://github.com/dististik/Nameless.js/blob/rewrite/README.md#installing)'s installation section for more information.

+ `config.json` - An empty template for a config file, place it in `src`.
+ `discord_ids.json` - A copy of the json file Nameless uses to run currently, place it in `src/json` with alternative IDs from your run environment.
